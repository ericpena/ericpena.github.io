      <description>Logistic Growth Model The simple difference equation below will show exponential growth behavior:
$$x_t = a x_{t-1}$$
However, it is often the case that a population cannot grow indefinitely but rather reach a population limit. This limit is called the population&amp;rsquo;s carrying capacity. To create a model with exponential growth but also incorporate this convergence to a population maximum limit, we may start with the following train of thought:
$$x_t = f(x_{t-1}) x_{t-1}$$</description>

      <description>Logistic Map The famous logistic map is a recurrence relation or polynomial mapping of degree 2. It is a nonlinear difference equation capable of capturing complex nonlinear dynamical behavior including chaos. This map was popularized by the biologist Robert May in a Nature article written in 1976. Sadly, Robert May has passed away recently on April 28, 2020. The equation is as follows:
$$x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$$</description>
