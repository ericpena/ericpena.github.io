      <description>Probability Will Knock Your Socks Off! Probability pops up everywhere! One day, I was digging in a basket of (clean) clothes in search of socks pulling several of them out one by one. However, I pulled six socks out but none of them matched! I thought to myself: what the heck is the probability of THAT happening? So let&amp;rsquo;s dig into how one might figure this out. But before we start answering this, let&amp;rsquo;s be more clear about what the situation is.</description>

      <description>What is a P-Value! (in Hypohtesis Testing) An average person might say p-values are of utmost importance in a student&amp;rsquo;s statistical toolbox. However, while teaching statistics and probability, I have noticed its subtle definition and conceptual underpinnings being grossly under-emphasized. This note may help clarify what a p-value is and how we use it to make decisions.
To explain what a p-value is, I will start with the &amp;ldquo;p&amp;quot;. What does it stand for?</description>
